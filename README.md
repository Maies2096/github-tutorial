SSH Key:
Alternative way to identify yourself that does not require you to enter your username and password every time
Could be used like a public key that gets shared with services like Github/ private key that stored only on your computer
ssh command provides a secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network
SSH (Secure Shell) is used for managing networks, operating systems, and configurations.
Clone ssh
Not http
Use SSH when cloning, http will ask for your password every time you try to clone

## Repository Setup
In Git
Create a directory to contain the project.
Go into the new directory.
Type git init.
Write some code.
Type git add to add the files (see the typical use page).
git add puts "people in the staging area" of the "code" you ahev written in it
once you are done adding it and are ready to commit, use git commit -m" put a message here".
Git commit takes a "snapshot" of the items in the staging area
Git commit keeps track of changes
Once you are satisfied with your project and want to push the changes up from local to remote, where it can be safely stored, push it
- for pushing, use the command git push

In Github

name your repository
Add a description of your repository // optional
Choose to make the repository either public or private. ...
